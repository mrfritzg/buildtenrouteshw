        title: "Star Wars almost never happened",
        description: "Creator George Lucas had hit the jackpot in 1973 when he directed American Graffiti, which had a budget of only $777,000 (£624,389), but made $140m (£112m) at the box office. This prompted film studio United Artists to ask Lucas if there was anything else he’d like to make. He explained his idea of “a space opera that’s a bit like a western, a bit like James Bond”, along with a 14-page treatment for it, but United Artists passed on the idea. They weren’t alone either, and Lucas was rejected by Disney and Universal too. It wasn’t until Lucas stuck the idea in front of 20th Century Fox, who trusted his talent to ensure the film was a success. And here we are, 45 years, 12 movies and around 10 billion dollars later"

        title: "Darth Vader almost sounded very different",
        description: "Who is the villainous Darth Vader without the deeply dramatic voice of James Earl Jones? Originally, Lucas was hoping to pin down author and director, Orson Welles, to read the lines of the infamous Sith Lord. Eventually deciding that the Citizen Kane star’s voice would be too recognisable, Lucas decided to look in another direction, and Pat Roach auditioned for the voice of Vader. He obviously didn’t get the role, but Lucas then cast him across several of the Indiana Jones films. "

        title: "Luke Skywalker was almost played by Freddy Krueger",
        description: "Lucas wanted the main protagonist of Star Wars to be someone completely unknown to audiences, and the other names who auditioned for Luke Skywalker were also relatively new on the Hollywood scene. Mark Hamil was the one to make it through as the young Jedi, but William Katt, who played Tommy Ross in horror flick Carrie was in serious contention for the iconic role. Lucas’ American Graffiti star Charles Martin Smith also tried out for the role, but ended up playing Oscar Wallace in 1987’s The Untouchables.  It was Robert Englund who missed out on both Han Solo and Luke Skywalker, but it all worked out for the best when he then went on to play horror fan-favourite Freddy Krueger in the Nightmare on Elm Street series.      Despite rumours that it was Robert who encouraged Mark to audition for the role of Luke, Hamil himself disputed that story, but none-the-less, the rest is history.ayers never could advance the ball. Instead, each player had to throw it from wherever he caught it. The first team credited with advancing the ball by dribbling it played at Yale in 1897, and the official allowance for the dribble, just one per possession at first, were adopted four years later."

        title: "The famous opening crawl was actually on a big bit of paper",
        description: "When the film was first being made in 1977, CGI obviously wasn’t as advanced as it was during some of the more modern SW films, so you had to be a bit inventive to get computer graphics to work. It turns out that the long title crawl at the start of the film, describing the lore ahead of the action, was actually a 6ft long piece of black paper with yellow text, and the camera was then rolled over the paper to make it appear as if the text was moving. Genius! "

        title: "Han Solo was almost played by some seriously big names.",
        description: "In other casting facts, it turns out most of the big hitters in Hollywood were given the script to play dashing Han Solo in Star Wars.  Lucas had reportedly based the personality of the Millenium Falcon captain on his filmmaker friend, Francis Ford Coppola, and had The Wire actor Glynn Turman in mind to play him. But Lucas changed his mind, and ended up sending scripts to the likes of James Caan, Jack Nicholson, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Burt Reynolds. Those who auditioned included Kurt Russell, Christopher Walken, Sylvester Stallone, John Travolta, Chevy Chase and James Woods. While we’re sure any of these men could’ve done Han Solo justice, we just can’t see it being anyone other than Harrison Ford."

        title: "We almost heard R2-D2 speak",
        description: "While we love the beeps and bloops of adorable droid R2-D2, it turns out they were almost replaced with actual lines of dialogue. Yes, instead of furiously beeping at counterpart C-3PO throughout the first film, words were literally taken out of R2-D2’s mouth in the post production process, meaning those unmistakable sounds almost never made it. It’s a tradition seen across the Star Wars franchise, with characters like BB-8 mimicking the noises made famous by Artoo, but we’re thankful our favourite droids got to speak in their own language. It just wouldn’t be the same."
