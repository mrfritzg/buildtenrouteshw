        title: "Pokémon means 'Pocket Monsters",
        description: "Pokémon is an abbreviation of 'Poketto Monsutā' which means 'Pocket Monster' in Japanese. Because they fit in your pocket, of course! Although luckily they live in Poke balls, imagine the mess if they used your pockets as a loo...."

        title: "Saudi Arabia banned Pokémon at one point",
        description: "Saudi Arabia aren't famous for being super relaxed about stuff. Apparently Pokémon was promoting polytheism (Belief in more than one god) and other things the government weren't happy about. You can still watch Pokémon in Saudi Arabia, but only in English. Luckily the country is becoming a bit more relaxed about it, and younger fans can finally see what all the fuss was about!"

        title: "Pikachu directly translates as 'Sparkly mouse noise'",
        description: "If you ever wondered where the Pokémon names come from, Pikachu is a good example of how random they can be. 'Pika' is from 'Pikapika' which means 'glitter or sparkle' and 'chu' is from 'chuchu' the noise a mouse makes. Put them together and you have Sparkle Mouse Noise! For some reason. Pikachu is a sort of mouse, right?"

        title: "Lots of Pokémon names are puns",
        description: "For example, the powers of Mimikyu are literally to 'mimic you'. And Sudowoodo? 'Psudo wood', or fake wood. Squirtle is a reference to the fact that he's a turtle who can squirt water, and Charmander is so -called because it's a fire Pokémon which can 'char' you. Which other clever names can you spot?."

        title: "Pokémon was created by a video game designer called Satoshi Tajiri in 1995",
        description: "He first thought of the idea way back in 1990. He was inspired by the fact that Gameboys could communicate, and began dreaming up a game that would link two Gameboys. At first, no body really understood Satoshi's Pokémon idea, and the company struggled trying to produce it. Satoshi didn't even take a salary during this time, but eventually the game was released and became a huge success!."

        title: "There was originally a Pokémon based on Dolly the Sheep, but it was scrapped.",
        description: "You may have heard of Dolly - she's no ordinary sheep! Dolly was the first ever mammal to be cloned, in Scotland in 1996, and was therefore very popular and well known in the 90s. Sadly, the Dolly Pokémon never happened, but there IS a sheep Pokémon - but it's called Wooloo, not Dolly!."

        title: "The 'Gotta Catch 'Em All' ethos has a back story",
        description: "Satoshi's idea about collecting animals in Pokémon came from his love of being in the garden as a child. As a boy, he would spend hours finding and collecting bugs and insects. In fact he spent so much time doing it, his friends called him 'Dr. Bug', and he originally wanted to become a bug scientist - or entomologist, to give it its proper name. We're glad he decided to work in video games instead!."
